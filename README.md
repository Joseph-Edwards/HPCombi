# HPCombi
High Performance Combinatorics in C++ using vector instructions v0.0.8

SSE and AVX instruction sets allows for very fast manipulation of
combinatorial objects such as transformations, permutations, boolean matrices
of small size. The goal of this project is to implement various new algorithms
and benchmark them on various compiler and architecture.
